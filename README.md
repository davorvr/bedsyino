# BeDSyino

#### What is it?

The **[BeDSy (Behaviour-recording Device Synchroniser)](https://github.com/davorvr/bedsy)** is a platform for hardware triggering and synchronisation of equipment for laboratory animal behavioural monitoring. For more information about the BeDSy platform, check the **[BeDSy repository](https://github.com/davorvr/bedsy)**.

The platform consists of two components: the **[BeDsy Python package](https://github.com/davorvr/bedsy)**, which interfaces with the **BeDSyino**, a hardware platform which sends custom trigger signals to animal behaviour-monitoring devices.

The BeDSyino is based on the [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html) platform (with plans to migrate to the Teensy 4.1) and [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html).

#### Current state

The [BeDSyino](https://github.com/davorvr/bedsyino) is still cooking. While the code is mostly complete, only a single hand-soldered, protoboard-based prototype has been developed thus far. A modular, extensible hardware platform is currently in the works and hardware files will be uploaded as soon as it's ready. The `.ino` file contains a lot of (hopefully) helpful comments, but more work on the documentation is necessary.
